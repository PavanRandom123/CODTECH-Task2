Project Overview: Student Grade Tracker
Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a Python program that helps users (students or educators) track and manage student grades. The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and displays the overall performance, including the corresponding letter grade and GPA.

Key Features:
Input of Grades:

The program prompts the user to enter the number of subjects or assignments.
For each subject or assignment, the user is asked to provide the name and corresponding grade.
Grade Calculation:

The program calculates the average grade based on the grades entered by the user.
It then determines the letter grade and GPA using predefined criteria.
Grade Display:

The program provides a summary of all the grades entered.
It displays the average grade, the corresponding letter grade, and the GPA.
Core Components:
calculate_letter_grade(average):

A function that takes the average grade as input and returns the corresponding letter grade and GPA.
The grading scale is defined as:
A for averages 90 and above, with a GPA of 4.0.
B for averages 80-89, with a GPA of 3.0.
C for averages 70-79, with a GPA of 2.0.
D for averages 60-69, with a GPA of 1.0.
F for averages below 60, with a GPA of 0.0.
main():

The main function that orchestrates the program.
It prompts the user for input, processes the data, and then displays the results.
It collects grades for each subject, calculates the total and average, determines the letter grade and GPA, and finally, displays all this information in a summary format.
User Interaction:
The program interacts with the user through text-based input and output.
The user inputs the number of subjects, the name of each subject, and the corresponding grade.
The program then calculates and outputs the results, making it easy for users to understand their overall performance.
Example Workflow:
The user runs the program and is welcomed with a message.
The user is prompted to enter the number of subjects or assignments.
For each subject, the user enters the name and grade.
The program calculates the average grade, determines the letter grade and GPA, and then prints a summary of the grades, the average, the letter grade, and the GPA.
Applications:
This program can be used by students to keep track of their grades and understand their academic performance.
Educators can use it to quickly calculate and report grades to students.
It can be expanded or modified to include more complex grading systems or additional features, such as handling different weightings for assignments.
Conclusion:
The Student Grade Tracker is a simple yet effective tool for managing academic grades, providing users with a clear overview of their performance through calculated averages, letter grades, and GPA. This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, including user input, loops, conditionals, and functions.
